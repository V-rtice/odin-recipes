    <h2>Ingredient List</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup key lime juice, or lime juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup orange juice</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, sliced very thinly into feathers</li>
        <li>1 chile rocoto pepper, or 2 aji limón chile, or habanero peppers</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to Make It</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cut the fish into small pieces. Dice the fish or leave it in pieces of up to 1-inch square, but remember that the larger the pieces, the longer it will take to marinate.</li>
        <li>Place the fish in a non-reactive bowl, add the salt, and pour the lime juice, lemon juice, and orange juice on top.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions and the chiles into the fish mixture and toss a few times to distribute.</li>
        <li>Chill the fish mixture in the fridge for at least 2 to 3 hours. If your fish is truly sushi quality, it is fine if the centers of the pieces are still raw-looking.​</li>
        <li>To serve, lay down some of the onions and chiles and top with the fish. Add some of the citrus juices on top. Garnish with the cilantro.</li>
